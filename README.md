# Brainwallet Attacker with Seed based on User's File Input (.txt,.csv or .dat) -
A Simple Console Application giving user the ability to set a file as input and generate a public Bitcoin Address and Private key.
In addition The Generated Address is Scanned and its Balance appears on Screen. 

Thanks to W W W . B I T C O I N W H O S W H O , which is the site used to get the balance from.

### Additional Information
I am not responsible of any use of this console appication.
This is an experimental build for fun not ittented to get any balance at all thats why this console application does not use BlockChain API.
